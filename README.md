# Bantumi Game

Bantumi is an African board game, which resembles chess in that the game is entirely decided by skill.
there is no random element. I came to know it as bantumi but it is also known as mancala.
The rules themselves are remarkably simple, but the strategies available are many and varied, and can be extremely complex.
