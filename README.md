In this project we will work on the aspects related to data persistence (using preferences, files and databases). To do so, it is recommended to start by reading the documents Settings and Data and file storage overview. In order to go deeper into these contents, the game known as Bantumi has been developed, which is a game for two players (the second player in this case will be the app itself).
There are multiple variants of this game, in this case the rules to be applied are the following:

It is played on a board with 14 holes: 6 squares facing each other and a storehouse for each player. The 6 squares that belong to each player -player's field- are those closest to the player. The storehouse is located to the right of each player.
The game starts by placing 4 seeds in each of the 6 squares of each player. The storehouses are initially empty.
Alternatively, each player chooses one of his 6 squares - which cannot be empty -, collects all the seeds it contains and "sows" them one by one counterclockwise in the following squares of the board (except in the opponent's storehouse). The following rules apply:
If the seeding ends in one's own storehouse, the player gets the turn again.

If the sowing ends in an empty own square, the last seed and the seeds in the opposite square of the other player are moved to the own store.

The game ends when any of the two players have all their squares empty. If the other player has seeds available, these will go to the store of the owner of the squares.

The winner is the player who has the highest number of seeds in his store.
